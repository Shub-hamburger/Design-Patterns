Principle 1: Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don't.

Principle 2: Program to an interface, not an implementation.

Principle 3: Favor composition over inheritance.

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it.
